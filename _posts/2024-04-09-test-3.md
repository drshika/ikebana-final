Inspired by the vase's round shape, the "Bubble Bliss" arrangement depicts a light, airy mood. Cool-toned flowers like carnations and babyâ€™s breath complement the blue vase, creating an ethereal ambiance. Bear grass forms a dominant bubble shape, echoed by palm leaves and leather fern. Curled bear grass adds a 3D element for balance.
