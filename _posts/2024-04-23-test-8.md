"Serpentine Light" captures the joyous essence of a Black Swan event. Curved Japanese Euonymus forms a swan shape, with vibrant daffodils adding happiness. Subordinate elements like Spirea and Boston Fern enhance the composition, while Ma and wrapped vials highlight the unexpected joy emerging from the arrangement's structure.
