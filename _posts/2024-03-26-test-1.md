excerpt: "Showing harmony through growing flowers."
---

The arrangement symbolizes the young, delicate nature of spring flowers, showcasing harmony despite imperfection. Pink and white mums harmonize with green aspidistra and white baby's breath. Horizontal structure reflects natural growth, with dominant bloomed mums and stretching aspidistra leaves. Mum buds represent growth, baby's breath adds depth. Negative space symbolizes youthful potential.
