The arrangement titled "Warm Hug" depicts a theme of togetherness and warmth, inspired by the image of two gerbera daisies embracing. Warm-toned colors evoke happiness, while the vertical arrangement accentuates the hug. Virginia pepperweed adds a fuzzy texture, symbolizing warmth. Hypericum and foliage create balance, forming a loving family of flowers.
