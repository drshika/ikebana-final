This arrangement aims to evoke a sense of peace and contentment akin to being in bed. Featuring a vertical structure with curved lines for tranquility, it emphasizes Ma (negative space) for harmony. Periwinkle, Babyâ€™s Breath, and Weeping Willow create a serene atmosphere, with cool tones symbolizing calmness. The circular elements draw your focus to the center, reflecting the container's shape and completing the peaceful ambiance.
