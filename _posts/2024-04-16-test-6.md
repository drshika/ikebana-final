This arrangement embodies the crackling energy of fire, with deeper hues at the base transitioning to brighter tones above. Warm-toned alstroemeria, hypericum, and Alum Root create a gradient, while a yellow mum and common sea lavender represent the fiery upper reaches. Slanting composition and asymmetry evoke the dynamic movement of flames, radiating energy outward.
